# 💫 About Me

I'm Dhanush B, Front-end Engineer Intern @Amazon and a passionate software developer creating innovative, high-performance applications. I specialize in building sleek, user-friendly front-end interfaces and robust, scalable back-end systems. My love for problem-solving drives me to deliver creative, clean, and efficient code.


My journey in tech has been incredibly rewarding - from winning hackathons (still amazed by those 5 wins!) to building @ArnaAI, where we're working on something that I hope will make lives a little better. I love working with MERN stack and Next.js

Currently building cool stuff @4D_Devs. Let's build something meaningful together! 😊
